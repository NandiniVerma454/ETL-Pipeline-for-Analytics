## Unified Retail Dataset ETL Pipeline for Analytics

ðŸ“‚Project Overview

This project demonstrates an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline built using Python in Google Colab for processing and analyzing a unified retail dataset. The pipeline covers all essential stages of ETL â€” from extracting data, transforming it into a cleaner and more analyzable form, to loading it for downstream analytics or visualization.

BASICS:

- Extract: Data is loaded from source files (CSV or other formats) into the Colab environment.
- Transform: Data cleaning, handling missing values, type conversions, feature engineering, and merging of data from different sources.
- Load: Processed data is saved into new files or prepared for visualization/analytics.
